Still using constructor-based DI in Angular? You're missing out on cleaner code and better flexibility.

Angular v14 introduced the `inject()` function, and by v19, it's become the recommended pattern. Here's why it matters:

**3 Key Benefits:**

1. **Less Boilerplate** → Fewer lines, cleaner code
2. **Better Inheritance** → No super() calls, no tight coupling
3. **More Flexible** → Conditional injection, functional guards, effects

If you're building Angular 19+ apps, `inject()` isn't just "nice to have"—it's the path forward.

I wrote a detailed guide covering:
→ Side-by-side comparisons
→ Migration strategies
→ When to use each approach
→ Real-world examples
