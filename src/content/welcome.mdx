This is my **first blog post** using MDX with Next.js! Here's what makes MDX powerful for creating rich content.

## Features Demonstrated

### Typography Styles

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- _Italic text_ for subtle emphasis
- `inline code` for technical terms
- [Links](https://nextjs.org) with hover effects

### Lists and Structure

This is a list in markdown:

1. **Ordered lists** work great
2. **Nested content** is supported
3. **Rich formatting** throughout

And unordered lists too:

- One
- Two
- Three

### Code Examples

Here's some inline `code` and a code block:

```javascript
const greeting = 'Hello, MDX!';
console.log(greeting);
```

### Blockquotes

> **Good to know**: This is a styled blockquote that stands out from regular content with custom borders and background.

### More Content

This paragraph demonstrates the improved typography with better spacing, colors, and responsive design. The styling works seamlessly with both light and dark themes.

Thanks for reading! This demonstrates the power of styled MDX content in Next.js.
