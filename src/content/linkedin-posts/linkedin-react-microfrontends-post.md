ðŸš€ **Just dropped: "Scaling React Applications with Microfrontends and Vite"**

After building production-ready microfrontend architectures with React and Vite, I've documented every optimization, gotcha, and "wish I knew this earlier" moment.

**What you'll discover:**
âœ… The ONE build system combination that makes HMR work seamlessly across microfrontends  
âœ… Why React + Vite beats traditional webpack federation setups  
âœ… The module federation patterns that enable true team independence  
âœ… Error boundary strategies that prevent cascading failures  

**Real talk:** Microfrontends aren't just about code splittingâ€”they're about enabling multiple teams to ship independently without stepping on each other.

**The kicker?** I've included the complete working setup with Hot Module Replacement that updates remote components instantly in your host application.

Don't let your React architecture become a bottleneck. Read it here: [blog-link]
