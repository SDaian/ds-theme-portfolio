# LinkedIn Post: Web Accessibility Blog Announcement

🌍 **Why Web Accessibility Isn't Optional (And How to Get It Right)**

Just published a comprehensive guide on building inclusive user interfaces that work for everyone. With 1.3 billion people worldwide living with disabilities, accessibility isn't just good practice—it's essential.

📝 **What's Inside:**
✅ Real-world React code examples with accessibility best practices
✅ WCAG 2.1 guidelines explained with practical implementations
✅ Advanced patterns: focus trapping, live regions, keyboard navigation
✅ Testing strategies with Playwright and axe-core
✅ Business case: $13 trillion disability market + legal compliance

💡 **Key Insight:** Good accessibility is invisible. When done right, users don't notice the accessibility features—they just experience a well-designed, intuitive interface.

The blog post breaks down a real React component to show how semantic HTML, ARIA labels, and proper focus management create better experiences for everyone—not just users with disabilities.
