# LinkedIn Post: Angular Image Custom Directive

ðŸš€ **Have you ever built an app only to see ugly broken image icons ruin the user experience? I just solved this with a powerful Angular directive using signals API!**

User experience suffers when images fail to load, showing ugly broken image icons that make applications look unprofessional. Every developer has faced this challenge, but the solution is more accessible than you might think.

**The Challenge:**
Image loading failures are inevitable - network issues, broken URLs, server problems - yet most applications handle this poorly, leaving users staring at broken image placeholders that hurt the overall experience and perceived reliability.

**The Solution:**
I created an Angular directive that leverages signals and effects to provide seamless image fallback handling. The directive automatically detects failed image loads and switches to a fallback image without any user intervention.

**Key Highlights:**
âœ… Uses Angular's modern signals API for reactive state management
âœ… Automatic fallback switching with zero configuration needed
âœ… Flexible selector patterns for different use cases
âœ… Seamless integration with existing img elements

**Why This Matters:**
- Eliminates broken image icons that hurt user experience
- Provides consistent fallback behavior across the entire application
- Reduces support requests related to "missing images"
- Improves perceived reliability and professionalism
- Leverages modern Angular features for optimal performance

This implementation showcases how modern Angular's reactive capabilities can solve real UX problems with minimal code. Just a few lines create a reusable solution that enhances image handling across any Angular application.
