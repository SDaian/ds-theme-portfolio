ðŸš€ **Just dropped: "Angular v16 to v20 Migration: What I Learned the Hard Way"**

After migrating a full chess game application through 4 major Angular versions, I've documented every pitfall, breakthrough, and "why didn't anyone tell me this?" moment.

**What you'll discover:**
âœ… The ONE build system change that breaks everything (and how to fix it)  
âœ… Why standalone components aren't just "nice to have" anymore  
âœ… The template syntax revolution that cuts bundle size by 20KB+  
âœ… Signal-based architecture gotchas that cost me 3 hours of debugging  

**Real talk:** Angular 20 isn't just an upgradeâ€”it's a complete paradigm shift. Teams still on v16-18 are falling behind fast.

**The kicker?** I've included the exact migration checklist and automation commands that saved me 40+ hours of manual work.
