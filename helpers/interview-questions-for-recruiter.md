# Questions to Ask the Recruiter

When the recruiter asks "Do you have any questions?", here are strategic questions to ask:

## 1. Why do you like working here?

**Purpose**: Hiring managers like candidates who are interested in others, and they can give you a good idea about the company culture.

**Follow-up variations**:
- "What's been the most rewarding part of your experience at eDreams ODIGEO?"
- "How would you describe the team dynamics in the Accommodation area?"
- "What makes this company different from other travel tech companies you've worked with?"

## 2. Is there anything about my background or skillset that I can clarify for you?

**Purpose**: If they have any reservations about you, this is a chance for you to clarify any doubts they may have about you.

**Follow-up variations**:
- "Are there any concerns about my fit for this role that I can address?"
- "Is there any part of my experience you'd like me to elaborate on?"
- "How do you see my background aligning with what the team needs right now?"

## 3. Do you have a timeline on when a decision may be made?

**Purpose**: This gives you a more concrete timeline on hearing back so you're not left wondering when you may be contacted by the recruiter.

**Follow-up variations**:
- "What are the next steps in the interview process?"
- "When should I expect to hear back about moving forward?"
- "How many rounds are typically involved in the selection process?"
