## Session Log
*Interview paused - to be resumed later*

### Technical Discussion - IN PROGRESS
- **Questions asked**: 
  - Introduction and background
  - Microfrontends architecture (shared state, performance, deployment independence)
- **Responses**: 
  - Strong background: 8+ years, Angular/React, Vueâ†’Angular migration with Module Federation
  - Mentioned shared dependencies, Redux/useContext for state management
- **Areas explored**: 
  - Version conflict handling in shared dependencies
  - Cross-application state sharing challenges (Redux/Context limitations)
  - Performance implications of microfrontends
  - Deployment independence strategies
- **Status**: Completed technical discussion, moved to coding challenge (paused), now starting system design
- **Key insights**: 
  - Understands Module Federation basics
  - Suggested props, context, custom events for cross-app communication
  - Identified persistence need, suggested cookies (has limitations for complex data)
  - **Gap identified**: Testing cross-application scenarios
- **Learning moment**: Provided Jest + React Testing Library examples for microfrontends testing
- **TDD Understanding**: Demonstrated solid grasp of Red-Green-Refactor cycle and unit-first approach
- **Architecture Design**: Good instincts on flexible cart system, chose maintainable type mapping approach

### Coding Challenge - Flight Search Component
- **Problem given**: Build real-time flight search with debouncing, loading/error states, cart integration
- **Solution approach**: 
  - React functional component with TypeScript interfaces
  - Custom useDebounce hook for performance (300ms delay)
  - useState for query, flights, loading, error states  
  - useEffect for API calls triggered by debouncedQuery
  - Integration with saveItemToCart function from architecture discussion
- **Testing strategy**: 
  - Unit tests for useDebounce hook
  - Component tests for user interactions
  - Integration tests with mocked API calls
- **Key considerations**: 
  - Performance optimization through debouncing
  - Proper TypeScript interface design
  - Error boundary integration
  - Accessibility (loading states, ARIA labels)
- **Status**: Challenge paused, approach documented

### System Design - Real-Time Flight Search Platform
- **Scenario presented**: 10M daily searches, real-time price updates, global scale, mobile-first
- **Design approach**: 
  - Microfrontends: Shell app + Search/Results/Booking teams
  - Real-time updates: WebSocket vs polling discussion
  - Caching: Three-layer strategy (browser, CDN, application)
- **Architecture decisions**: Guided through simple, practical approaches
- **Status**: Discussion paused, moving to behavioral questions

### Behavioral Questions
- Questions asked:
- STAR method responses:
- Areas to improve:

## Post-Interview Feedback
*To be completed after the simulation*

### Strengths Demonstrated:
- 

### Areas for Improvement:
- **Testing Strategy**: Need to strengthen TDD approach and testing pyramid understanding
- **Cross-Application Architecture**: Study localStorage vs cookies vs API-based state management
- **Module Federation**: Deepen understanding of shared dependencies and version management

### Overall Assessment:
- Technical competency: /10
- Problem-solving approach: /10
- Communication skills: /10
- Senior-level thinking: /10

### Next Steps:
- **Study Jest + React Testing Library patterns** for microfrontends testing
- **Practice TDD workflow**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle with cross-app scenarios  
- **Research Module Federation best practices** for state sharing and dependency management
- **Mock interview follow-up**: Practice GraphQL and TypeScript deep-dive questions
